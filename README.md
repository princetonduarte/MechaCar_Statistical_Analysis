## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

 	The weight, spoiler_angle & AWD provided a non-random amount of variance. With ground_clearance and vehicle_length had the most amount of random variance.

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  
## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils,
- The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

  Lot 1 and Lot 2 specifications are almost exact. While Lot 3 shows that it exceeds the specs for the MechaCar.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
- How much horsepower and Mile Per Gallon seems to be the biggest critieria for selecting a car. Using these test can help determine how different MechaCar is. Stating that these factors would not be any different the the competition is a null hypothesis.
